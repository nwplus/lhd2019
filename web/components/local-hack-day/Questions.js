            A hackathon is an event where teams collaborate on a project or &quot;hack&quot; within
            a tight time limit. At nwHacks, teams of 2-4 collaborate over 24 hours to
            challenge the status quo, fulfill prize challenges, and create meaningful impact.
            Industry professionals from the local community mentor at hackathons to share their
            experiences, support projects from a technical perspective, and meet the younger
            generation of hackers. The winners will be chosen by a panel of judges comprised
            of top industry professionals.

            Have no fear! Hackathons are really a place for learning and one of the best ways
            to do so. We&apos;ll have series of workshops to bootstrap you for hacking. And when
            you run into any problems or questions, mentors will be happy to help you out.
            By the time you walk out, you will have new skills, friends, and a project
            under your belt!

            On the first day of nwHacks, we will also facilitate team building so no one gets
